# SCCM 2024

The 4th Workshop on Security for Custom Computing Machines (SCCM) will be held in conjunction with [FPL 2024](http://asaclab.polito.it/fpl2024/). 

Interest in hardware security and secure computing systems continues to grow.  Recent events have raised awareness of security in general-purpose processors.  However, addressing security in custom computing machines is also of high importance, given their increasing use in environments where security and privacy are paramount, including defense, medical, transportation, and communication systems.  The SCCM workshop allows researchers in this space to present recent work, discuss current security priorities, and collaborate on future research directions.

## Date & Time
**Monday, September 2, 2024. Time TBD**  

## Location
**Co-located with FPL 2024 in Turin, Italy.  Exact location TBD.**
