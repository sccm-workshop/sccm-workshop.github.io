# Workshop on Security for Custom Computing Machines (SCCM) 
Interest in hardware security and secure computing systems continues to grow.  Recent events have raised awareness of security in general-purpose processors.  However, addressing security in custom computing machines is also of high importance, given their increasing use in environments where security and privacy are paramount, including defense, medical, transportation, and communication systems.  The SCCM workshop allows researchers in this space to present recent work, discuss current security priorities, and collaborate on future research directions.

**We have not yet scheduled our next iteration of the SCCM workshop, but hope to do so soon. In the mean time, please check out the previous years' content:**
