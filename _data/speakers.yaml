    Dr. Jonathan Graf, CEO of Graf Research, will share how Graf Research is developing a new generation of configurable computing tools for electronic design automation and verification—tools that create independent, trustworthy views of FPGA configuration and silicon correctness. 

    Among these innovations is a method for bitstream equivalence checking, Enverite PV-Bit, which confirms whether an FPGA’s bitstream truly matches the intended gate-level netlist. Another is Ensofic, a silicon attestation platform that combines soft sensors with machine learning to evaluate both the reliability and authenticity of an FPGA, including the ability to spot counterfeit devices.

    The talk will also cover what it takes to turn research prototypes into practical, commercial-grade solutions ready for deployment in high-stakes industries like aerospace, automotive, defense, and energy. Drawing on hands-on experience with deployed commercial solutions, Dr. Graf will outline key lessons learned and show how these projects have inspired unexpected new applications. The result is a clear picture of challenges and how the security of custom computing machines can advance rapidly in the years ahead.

  title: "Differential fault attack on PQC (Dilithium) implementation for key recovery"
  desc: |-
    We are moving to an era where quantum computing threatens the confidentiality of current cryptographic protocols, specifically around “harvest now, decrypt later” attacks. Algorithms such as CRYSTALS-Kyber and CRYSTALS-Dilithium, selected as NIST  standards, are built on well-studied and mathematically robust foundations. However, strong algorithmic design alone is not enough. A cryptographic system remains vulnerable if the implementation is insecure—algorithmic security does not guarantee implementation security. We will see example on how Fault Injection could be still relevant for PQC.

  title: "CHEQ: Towards Enabling Circuit Integrity Checking in Quantum Controllers"
  desc: |- 
    Rapid advances in quantum computing hardware and software are bringing closer the promise of new discoveries and breakthroughs that these machines will enable. To fully utilize and trust quantum computers, however, users need assurances about the confidentiality and integrity of quantum circuits they execute on quantum computers. While existing research has begun to address the issues of quantum circuit confidentiality, there is lack of quantum computer architecture or hardware designs for ensuring and checking the integrity of quantum circuits. This gap in existing research and design of quantum computers is addressed in this talk. It outlines the design of CHEQ, our FPGA enabled Circuit Hashing Engine for Quantum controllers. By providing circuit integrity measurements to users through CHEQ, quantum computing systems can become more resilient to security threats that aim to attack circuit integrity. Combined with other prior work on confidentiality, the new CHEQ integrity assurance in quantum computers can enable complete circuit protection, and thus protection of future discoveries and breakthroughs generated by quantum computers.

  title: Towards smarter vehicular network interfaces for the software-defined vehicles era
  affiliation: Trinity College Dublin
  desc: |-
    Modern vehicles integrate over 100 electronic control units (ECUs) to manage a wide spectrum of safety-critical and comfort-oriented functions. These systems increasingly rely on external connectivity—via V2X communication and over-the-air (OTA) updates—to enhance capabilities and maintain operational relevance. However, the convergence of software-defined functionality with legacy in-vehicle network architectures (e.g., CAN, LIN, FlexRay) and off-the-shelf hardware (embedded control units or ECUs) introduces significant attack vectors. Recent studies have demonstrated that adversaries can exploit these vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access, inject malicious commands, and compromise core vehicular subsystems through relatively low-complexity network-based attacks. This underscores the urgent need for robust, in-vehicle security mechanisms that operate independently of the time- and safety-critical application on the ECUs. In this talk, we show a case for the integration of security primitives—specifically intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS)—directly within the network interface layer. By abstracting these functions below the application layer, we enable an ultra-low-latency threat mitigation and lay the groundwork for implementing security as a virtualized network function (VNF). This architectural shift is critical for building scalable, resilient, and secure vehicular communication frameworks in next-generation automotive platforms.
