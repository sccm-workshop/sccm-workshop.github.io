This webpage is built using Jekyll and served using Github Pages.

To edit and run locally, first [install jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/ubuntu/), then run `bundle update` and then `make serve`.  This will host a local web server where you can preview your changes before pushing them to github.

Changes pushed to Github on the main branch are automatically deployed to the website via a Github action.
