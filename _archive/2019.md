## Security for Custom Computing Machines

* *Date: Wednesday May 1, 2019*
* *Time: 8:00 am â€“ 12:15 pm*
* *Location: CSE 1242*
* *Organizers: Dustin Richmond (UW) and Ryan Kastner  (UCSD)*

Hardware security is an important design consideration. Recent events have raised awareness of security in general-purpose processors. As experts we must consider: What are equivalent equivalents for custom computing machines? How do we defend against threats that exist today? How do we design our systems to defend against future threats? This is increasingly important as we deploy custom computing machines at unprecedented scales.
